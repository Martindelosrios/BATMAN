Welcome to BATMAN! 

This is a code for analysing dark matter direct detection experiment
with Bayesian statistic using Machine Learning tools.

This code is presented in arxiv XXXX.XXXX and is build on top of `SWYFT <https://github.com/undark-lab/swyft>`_.

The main goal of BATMAN is to estimate the full posterior distribution
of some interesting parameter given new data :math:`P(\Theta|X)`!

This is done using the `TMNRE <https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08030>`_ (Truncated Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation) method.

.. note::

   This project is under active development.
